  Napalm is a flammable liquid used in warfare. It is a mixture of a gelling
  agent, and either petroleum or a similar fuel. It was initially used as an
  incendiary device against buildings and later primarily as an anti-personnel
  weapon, as it sticks to skin and causes severe burns when on fire.
